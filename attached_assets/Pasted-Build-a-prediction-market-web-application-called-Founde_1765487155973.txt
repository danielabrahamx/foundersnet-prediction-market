Build a prediction market web application called "FoundersNet" on Movement M1 blockchain where users trade outcome tokens representing predictions about private company valuations.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Smart Contracts: Move 2 language on Movement M1 blockchain
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Wallet: Privy embedded wallet integration
- Development: Use Movement DeFi Replit template as starting point

START BY:
1. Import Movement DeFi template from developer.movementnetwork.xyz
2. Install Privy SDK: npm install @privy-io/react-auth @privy-io/wagmi-connector
3. Configure Movement M1 network endpoints from Movement Builder Kit

SMART CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS (Move 2):

Module 1 - MarketFactory (sources/market_factory.move):
- Struct: Market { id, company_name, yes_token_supply, no_token_supply, total_liquidity, resolved, winning_outcome, expiry_timestamp }
- Function: create_market(company_name: String, initial_liquidity: u64, expiry_timestamp: u64)
- Function: get_market_details(market_id: u64) returns Market
- Store markets in global resource MarketRegistry

Module 2 - AMM (sources/amm.move):
- Implement constant product formula: x * y = k
- Function: buy_yes_tokens(market_id: u64, move_amount: u64) returns u64 (tokens received)
- Function: buy_no_tokens(market_id: u64, move_amount: u64) returns u64 (tokens received)
- Function: sell_yes_tokens(market_id: u64, token_amount: u64) returns u64 (MOVE received)
- Function: sell_no_tokens(market_id: u64, token_amount: u64) returns u64 (MOVE received)
- Calculate prices dynamically based on supply ratio
- Charge 2% fee on each trade, store in treasury

Module 3 - Resolution (sources/resolution.move):
- Function: resolve_market(market_id: u64, winning_outcome: bool) [admin only]
- Function: claim_winnings(market_id: u64, user_address: address)
- Emit event: MarketResolved { market_id, winning_outcome, timestamp }
- Calculate payouts: winners get proportional share of losing side's liquidity

Module 4 - Treasury (sources/treasury.move):
- Store all trading fees
- Function: get_treasury_balance() returns u64
- Admin withdrawal function for collected fees

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React + TypeScript):

Page 1 - Home/Market List (src/pages/Home.tsx):
- Display grid of active markets (company cards)
- Each card shows: company name, current YES price, 24h volume, time until expiry
- Filter buttons: "Active", "Resolved", "Trending"
- Search bar to find specific companies
- "Create Market" button (admin only for MVP)

Page 2 - Trading Interface (src/pages/TradingPage.tsx):
- Left panel: Company info (name, description, sector, funding history)
- Center panel: Trading interface
  - Two tabs: "BUY YES" and "BUY NO"
  - Input field: Amount of MOVE to spend
  - Display: Estimated tokens received, current price, price impact
  - "Execute Trade" button
  - Show user's current position in this market (YES tokens, NO tokens, cost basis)
- Right panel: Activity feed (recent trades in this market)
- Price chart showing YES token price over time (use recharts library)

Page 3 - Portfolio (src/pages/Portfolio.tsx):
- Table of user's active positions
- Columns: Company, Position (YES/NO), Tokens Held, Current Value, Unrealized P&L, Actions
- Section for claimable winnings from resolved markets
- Total portfolio value and total P&L summary

Components:
- Navbar (src/components/Navbar.tsx): Logo, nav links, Privy login button, wallet balance
- MarketCard (src/components/MarketCard.tsx): Reusable card for market list
- TradeForm (src/components/TradeForm.tsx): Buy/sell interface with price calculation
- PriceChart (src/components/PriceChart.tsx): Line chart using recharts

BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION (src/utils/movement.ts):
- Use Aptos SDK to interact with Movement M1
- Configure RPC endpoint: https://mainnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1 (get actual endpoint from Movement Builder Kit)
- Functions to export:
  - connectWallet(): Connect via Privy
  - getMarkets(): Query all markets from MarketRegistry
  - getMarketDetails(marketId): Get specific market data
  - executeBuyYes(marketId, amount): Submit buy transaction
  - executeBuyNo(marketId, amount): Submit buy transaction
  - executeSellYes(marketId, amount): Submit sell transaction
  - executeSellNo(marketId, amount): Submit sell transaction
  - claimWinnings(marketId): Claim resolved market winnings
  - getUserPositions(address): Get user's positions across all markets

PRIVY WALLET SETUP (src/App.tsx):
- Wrap app in PrivyProvider with config:
  - appId: "clpqhny8d00kgl80fqvul9026" (use Privy docs to get real ID)
  - config: { appearance: { theme: 'light' }, embeddedWallets: { createOnLogin: 'users-without-wallets' } }
- Add login button using usePrivy() hook
- Display connected wallet address when authenticated

STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Color scheme: Dark blue (#0f172a) primary, Green (#10b981) for YES, Red (#ef4444) for NO
- Modern financial dashboard aesthetic (think Robinhood/Coinbase)
- Mobile responsive using Tailwind breakpoints

SAMPLE DATA (Seed 5 Markets):
1. Market: "SpaceX valuation reaches $200B by Q2 2025", YES price: $0.65, Liquidity: 10,000 MOVE
2. Market: "OpenAI valued above $150B in next funding round", YES price: $0.72, Liquidity: 15,000 MOVE
3. Market: "Stripe IPO valuation exceeds $100B", YES price: $0.48, Liquidity: 8,000 MOVE
4. Market: "Databricks reaches $50B valuation", YES price: $0.55, Liquidity: 12,000 MOVE
5. Market: "Canva valued above $40B", YES price: $0.61, Liquidity: 9,000 MOVE

DEPLOYMENT:
- Smart contracts: Deploy to Movement M1 mainnet using Movement CLI
- Frontend: Deploy on Replit with environment variables for contract addresses
- Create .env file with: VITE_MARKET_FACTORY_ADDRESS, VITE_AMM_ADDRESS, VITE_MOVEMENT_RPC_URL

TESTING CHECKLIST:
- User can connect wallet via Privy
- Market list displays all 5 sample markets
- User can buy YES tokens (transaction succeeds, balance updates)
- User can buy NO tokens (transaction succeeds, balance updates)
- Portfolio shows user's positions correctly
- Prices update based on AMM formula when trades happen

DOCUMENTATION:
Create README.md with:
- Project description and use case
- How prediction markets work
- Setup instructions (install deps, deploy contracts, run frontend)
- Contract addresses on Movement M1 mainnet
- Architecture diagram (contracts <-> frontend flow)
- Demo video link placeholder

OUTPUT DELIVERABLES:
1. Fully functional Move 2 smart contracts deployed to Movement M1
2. React frontend with Privy wallet integration
3. Live demo URL on Replit
4. README with setup instructions
5. Contract addresses and deployment confirmation

CONSTRAINTS:
- Complete everything in one session
- Focus on working MVP over perfect UI
- Use Movement template to save time
- Privy handles wallet UX (no custom wallet code)
- AMM formula must be mathematically correct (test with sample trades)
- All contract functions must handle errors gracefully

PRIORITIZATION:
P0 (Must have): Market creation, buy YES/NO tokens, display markets, wallet connection
P1 (Should have): Portfolio page, price charts, market resolution
P2 (Nice to have): Activity feed, advanced filters, mobile optimization

Begin implementation now. Start with smart contracts, then frontend, then integration.
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR REPLIT AGENT
Movement M1 Specific Details:

Network Chain ID: Check Movement docs (likely different from Aptos mainnet)
Native token: MOVE (used for gas and trading)
Block time: ~1 second (fast finality)
Contract language: Move 2 (enhanced version with new syntax)
SDK: Use @aptos-labs/ts-sdk version compatible with Movement
Critical Implementation Notes:

Move 2 Syntax: Resources use struct keyword, functions use public entry for callable transactions
AMM Math: For buying YES tokens: tokens_out = (move_in * yes_supply) / (liquidity + move_in), adjust NO supply accordingly
Privy Integration: Must configure Movement M1 as custom chain in Privy config
State Management: Use React Context for blockchain state (markets, user positions)

Here's a strong response that addresses the agent's concerns while moving forward productively:

**Thanks for the realistic assessment. Let's go with Option 1 + a hybrid approach:**

**Immediate Action Items (This Session):**

1. **Build Integration-Ready Frontend** with:
   - Privy wallet authentication (working)
   - Contract interaction layer with TypeScript interfaces for all Move 2 functions
   - Admin dashboard with wallet verification and event creation forms
   - Real AMM calculations (x*y=k) for price display
   - Portfolio page pulling from wallet structure
   - All contract calls structured but pointing to `CONTRACT_CONFIG` object (easy swap later)

2. **Create Contract Config File** that looks like:
   ```typescript
   export const CONTRACTS = {
     marketFactory: "0x...", // placeholder
     amm: "0x...",
     treasury: "0x...",
     rpcEndpoint: "https://...", // Movement M1 testnet/mainnet
   };
   ```

3. **Structure Contract Calls** as:
   ```typescript
   // Real function signatures, will work immediately once addresses are filled in
   createMarket(name, description, expiryDate)
   buyYesTokens(marketId, amountNo)
   resolveMarket(marketId, outcome)
   claimWinnings(marketId)
   ```

**What I'll Handle:**
- Complete frontend with real Privy integration
- All UI/UX for trading, portfolio, admin features
- Error handling + loading states
- Transaction signing flow ready to go

**What You Need to Do (In Parallel):**
1. Set up Movement M1 CLI locally
2. Deploy your Move 2 contracts (MarketFactory, AMM, Treasury modules)
3. Provide me: contract addresses, RPC endpoint, admin wallet address
4. I update `CONTRACTS` config and we're live

**Questions for You:**
- Do you have the Move 2 contract code already written, or do you need me to outline what those contracts should do?
- Should the frontend work on Movement M1 testnet or mainnet initially?
- Do you have an admin wallet ready, or should we set one up?

Let's build the frontend now so it's ready the moment your contracts deploy.

**Why this works:** You're not waiting for contracts to be deployed—the frontend will be 100% complete and ready to plug in. The agent can't deploy contracts (reasonable), but they can build everything that surrounds them. Once you have contract addresses, it's literally a config file update and you're live.

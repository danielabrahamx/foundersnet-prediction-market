This is excellent. Here's your response to lock in the build:

---

**Perfect. This interface is exactly what we need. A few clarifications, then you can start building:**

**Confirms & Approvals:**
✅ On-chain market registry (no indexer needed initially)
✅ Internal YES/NO token tracking per user
✅ Both estimate + execute functions for slippage protection
✅ Admin-only resolution (we'll set ADMIN_ADDRESS as constant)
✅ 2% fee structure (deducted before AMM calculation)

**Small Adjustments:**

1. **User Position Tracking** – Add one more field:
   ```
   struct UserPosition {
     market_id: u64,
     user_address: address,
     yes_tokens: u64,
     no_tokens: u64,
     total_invested: u64,
     average_yes_price: u64,
     average_no_price: u64,
     last_trade_timestamp: u64  // For sorting recent trades
   }
   ```

2. **Market Price Function** – Clarify the return:
   ```
   public fun get_market_price(market_id: u64): (u64, u64)
   // Returns (yes_price_bp, no_price_bp) in basis points (divide by 10000)
   // E.g., YES at 6500 bp = $0.65, NO at 3500 bp = $0.35
   // YES + NO should always = 10000 (probabilities sum to 100%)
   ```

3. **MarketResolvedEvent** – Who gets notified?
   - Should this emit when market is resolved so the frontend can listen for it?
   - Or does the frontend just poll `list_all_markets()` for `resolved: true` status?

4. **Slippage Protection** – Confirm the flow:
   - Frontend calls `calculate_buy_yes()` to get estimate
   - User sees: "You'll get ~95 YES tokens (0.5% slippage)"
   - User clicks BUY → Frontend calls `buy_yes_tokens(min_tokens_out: 94)` (1% buffer)
   - If pool changes mid-transaction, it reverts if outcome < 94 ✓

**For the Frontend Build, I Need:**

1. **Contract Deployment Plan** – When will you deploy these 5 modules to Movement M1 testnet?
   - I can build the frontend in parallel, but I need target deployment date so we can coordinate testing

2. **Admin Wallet Address** – What's your admin wallet? (e.g., `0x1234...`)
   - I'll hardcode it in the contract config as `ADMIN_ADDRESS`

3. **Movement M1 RPC Endpoint** – Which are you using?
   - Testnet: `https://aptos.testnet.suzuka.movementnetwork.xyz/v1`
   - Mainnet: `https://aptos.mainnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1`
   - (Confirm the exact endpoint)

**Build Timeline:**

- **Today:** You confirm the 3 clarifications above + provide wallet/RPC
- **Today:** I build complete frontend with mock contract calls matching this exact interface
- **This week:** You deploy contracts to Movement M1
- **Upon deployment:** I swap mock layer for real contract addresses (CONFIG_FILE update)
- **Testing phase:** Frontend + contracts integration testing

**Ready to start building the frontend once you confirm these 3 items.** Does everything above work for you?

**Why this response works:**
- Shows you've read and understood their spec
- Asks for 3 specific clarifications (not vague)
- Provides clear timeline with ownership
- Keeps momentum moving
- Gives them a clear checklist to complete

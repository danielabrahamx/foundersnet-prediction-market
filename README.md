## 📜 Smart Contracts

### Contract Overview

The `prediction_market` module implements a **parimutuel betting system** with the following key functions:

| Function | Description | Access |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `initialize` | Sets up the market registry | Admin only |
| `create_market` | Create a new prediction market | Admin only |
| `buy_yes` / `buy_no` | Place a bet on an outcome | Public |
| `resolve_market` | Declare the winning outcome | Admin only |
| `claim_winnings` | Collect winnings from resolved markets | Winners only |

### Parimutuel Model

Unlike traditional order-book markets, FoundersNet uses a **parimutuel** system:

```
Payout = (Total Pool / Winning Pool) × Your Bet
```

- All bets go into a single pool
- Winners split the entire pool proportionally
- No counterparty risk - payouts are guaranteed by the smart contract

### Deploy to Movement

```bash
# Run Move tests first
npm run move:test

# Deploy to Movement
npm run move:deploy:movement
```

**Required environment variables:**
- `MOVEMENT_RPC_URL` - Movement fullnode REST endpoint
- `MOVEMENT_PRIVATE_KEY` - Deployer/admin private key (hex)

**Optional:**
- `MOVEMENT_PROFILE` - Aptos CLI profile name (default: `movement`)
- `MOVEMENT_RESOURCE_SEED_HEX` - Resource account seed (default: `01`)

Deployment manifest is written to: `contracts/deployments/movement.json`
